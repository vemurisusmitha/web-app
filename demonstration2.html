      <h3 style="color:white;">The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs 
        (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
         These correspond to create, read, <br>update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.
          There are a number of other verbs,<br> too, but are utilized less frequently.
